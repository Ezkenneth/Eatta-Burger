## Usage
    This application takes in users input; creating a burger by inoutting a name (be creative). The user can choose to add as many burgers as they please. The user can click the devour button next to the burger and it will be "devoured".  

    The data being inputted by the user is stored in a MySQL database, API calls are made to pull that information and display them.  

## Future Direction
* CSS reworks for page.
* Allowing user to clear lists and view older burgers.
* Allowing user to list specific ingredients for burgers (might use a relational database structure).
